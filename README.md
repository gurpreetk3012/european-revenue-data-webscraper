# European Revenue Data Web Scraper

In this project, I developed a beginner-friendly web scraping notebook using Python and libraries such as `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `pandas`. The objective was to extract revenue data for European companies from a publicly available website and convert the unstructured HTML content into a clean, analysis-ready dataset.

## Project Objective

My goal was to demonstrate the fundamental steps of web scraping by:

- Sending HTTP requests to a target web page
- Parsing HTML content with BeautifulSoup
- Extracting relevant tabular data (e.g., company names, countries, revenue figures)
- Structuring the data using pandas
- Using the final dataset for further use in data analysis


## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- `requests`
- `BeautifulSoup4`
- `pandas`
- Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)


## Output

The output is a structured table containing:

- Company Name  
- Country  
- Revenue (in billion EUR)

This dataset can serve as input for further analysis or visualization.
